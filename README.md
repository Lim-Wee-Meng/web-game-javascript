            <p>Iljimae is suppose to steal as many coins as possible until he reaches the 'shop' where the money will be delivered to the poors.
            Iljimae can jump very high and even fly accross but gravity will always pull him down. Typically, he stays on the roofs.
            If he falls to the ground, he is likely to be captured but he gets free and start all over again.</p>
